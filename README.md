-------------About the project-------------

So I am trying to make a multifunctional device using esp8266 D1 mini and an I2C 128x64 OLED display. 
At first I made a little pong console using arduino nano but I was poorly soldered and buttons used were cheap and malfunctioned
that is why I decided to make another device. I adapted the code a little bit and it kinda does run pong but there is some work
to do. So I created a github repository to help me save, modify and share the code.
