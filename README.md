# About the project

So I am trying to make a multifunctional device using esp8266 D1 mini and an I2C 128x64 OLED display. 
At first I made a little pong console using arduino nano but I was poorly soldered and buttons used were cheap and malfunctioned
that is why I decided to make another device. I adapted the code a little bit and it kinda does run pong but there is some work
to do. So I created a github repository to help me save, modify and share the code.

## Documentation for version 1.0.0

There is a class in the code called "menu" it supports only 4 elements in a menu. Also it has only one function "play()" which 
allows you to select something and it displays the menu. If you encouner any bugs of difficulties first check the upcoming tutorial
(If you can't find a link, I haven't made one yet), then check the latest pre_release. If you found that bug/problem, just wait until
I release a new version. If nothing satated above helps then message me ;)

### If you want to make your own 8266^3
There is a file called "READ ME (if you forgot connections).txt" where you can see all connections.
(there's some offensive language used but I wrote it for myself so don't think it is addressed to you)
